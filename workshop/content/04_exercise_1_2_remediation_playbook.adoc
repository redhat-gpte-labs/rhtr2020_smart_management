=== Verify Insights Registration

. Log into the insights portal at the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/insights/[Insights Dashboard^]

[NOTE]
The login information should be the same as your access.redhat.com credentials

. Click Inventory from the bar menu on the left side of the screem
. Within the search bar type `node.{GUID}.example.com`
. Select the server from the filtered results to see the system information

=== Create Remediation Playbook

. Select `Advisor` from the tab selection next to `General Information`

On the Advisor page we can see that Insights has detected some issues `New Ansible Engine packages are inaccessible when dedicated Ansible repo is not enabled`
This issue is resolvable by an automatically generated playbook. 

. Click the square box next to the `Description`
. Click the blue `Remediate` button
. Click the circle next to `Create new Playbook`
. Name the playbook `remediate-ansible-repo-{GUID}`
. Click the blue next button
. Click the sliding button next to `Auto reboot` as this is not required to update a repository
. Click the blue create button

=== Download Remediation Playbook

. Click `Remediations` from the bar menu on the left side of the screen
. Click the box next to the remediation you created `remediate-ansible-repo-{GUID}`
. Click the blue `Download playbooks` button and save the file locally
. Browse this file to view the auto generated remediation

Below is an example of what the playbook should look like. We can use this manual method to view what a rememdation playbook will exectue before implementing at scale.
